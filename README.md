* Upload an image of an outfit (background in white works best)
* It currently only accepts jpg and png file
* Click "Show Recommendations" button to retrieve recommendations
* To update results, simply click on the "Show Recommendations" button again
* Navigate over to the sidebar, at the "gallery", to explore sample results
