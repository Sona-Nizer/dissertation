### Revolutionising Fashion Design: An Automated Fashion Recommendation System Using Cnn Model

Fashion design has been transformed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning, with early applications focusing on tasks like trend forecasting and inventory management. As AI has evolved, technologies like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have automated parts of the design process. However, current AI tools often work in isolation, limiting their potential to revolutionize the entire fashion workflow.

The Automated Fashion Design System (AFDS) addresses these limitations by integrating all stages of the fashion design process, using advanced technique such as CNN. AFDS aims to enhance human creativity and tackle challenges like market relevance, creativity balance, and scalability. By combining AI with human input, AFDS offers a more holistic approach to fashion design, ensuring ethical, inclusive, and sustainable innovation.

This study highlights the importance of collaboration between technology and human creativity to fully unlock AI's potential in the fashion industry.

# How it works
* Upload an image of an outfit (background in white works best)
* It currently only accepts jpg and png file
* Click "Show Recommendations" button to retrieve recommendations
* To update results, simply click on the "Show Recommendations" button again
